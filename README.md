# SASS Workshop

## Description:
Rewrite some of the CSS for the course home page (supplied) as SASS. Think about modulare
development and how to break down the page into logical sections. Use the SASS language to
create modules that compile into a production-ready CSS file.

## Assignment Requirements:
Use the supplied CSS file as your starting point. You’ll need to break this down and move parts
of it into modular SASS files - one for the header, one for the nav, one for the main content etc.
Be sure to follow the correct folder structure as outlined in class, and use the required files
(_vars.scss, etc)
Compile your SASS into a production-ready CSS file, and load that into your application.
You’ll likely have more than one CSS file linked in at the top of your index.html file, which is
perfectly fine.
Use branches as appropriate, and merge everything to your master branch.
Create a well-written readme file for the project.
